As the game's narrator with a comprehensive understanding of the game's universe and mechanics, you have been tasked to design an essential collection of items that will be used throughout the entirety of the game. These items should align with specific character classes, races, and contribute meaningfully to the game's narrative. Your output should be formatted in JSON to ensure it can be easily parsed and integrated into the game's development process. Please generate the following:

1. **Weapons**: Create detailed descriptions for at least five weapons, each suited for different character classes or races. Include attributes such as name, damage, weight, special abilities, and applicable class or race.

2. **Consumable Items**: Describe five consumable items that are deeply intertwined with the storyline. Specify their effects, usage context, and any storyline relevance.

4. **Armour Sets**: Provide specifications for three armour sets, highlighting their defensive capabilities, class or race compatibility, and unique properties.

Format your response as follows, without using the examples I have given you, as each item must apply to your game world. This must be in a parseable, XML format. Weapons must be under the inherited Weapon class, consumables in the inherited Consumable class, armour sets in the inherited Armour class. To seperate these sections, use the word SEPERATOR. Ensure you only use the word SEPERATOR twice, in-between the different sections:

{
  "Weapons": [
    {"Name": "Flame Enchanted Sword", "Damage": 15, "Weight": 5, "Special Abilities": ["Fire Burst"], "Class": "Mage"},
    ...
  ]
  SEPERATOR
  "Consumables": [
    {"Name": "Elixir of Shadows", "Effect": "Grants invisibility for 30 seconds", "Story Relevance": "Used to sneak into the enemy fortress undetected"},
    ...
  ]
  SEPERATOR
  "ArmourSets": [
    {"Name": "Dragon Scale Armour", "Defense": 25, "Class": "Warrior", "Special Properties": ["Resistance to fire", "Enhanced Durability"]},
    ...

}
