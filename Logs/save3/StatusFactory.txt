INPUT: The Status class is designed to represent various effects in a game that can modify the attributes of entities, such as players or enemies, over a specified duration. Each status has a Name, which is a unique identifier, and a Type that specifies which attribute it affects, such as "Enemy_currentHealth" or "Player_Strength". The Increase boolean determines whether the attribute is positively or negatively affected, while the PercentBool decides if the intensity of the effect is a flat number (IntensityNumber) or a percentage (IntensityPercent). If Intensity is a percentage, output it as a number from 0-100 (e.g, "30" = 30%).

You need to provide:

name: A string representing the name of the status.
duration: A string representing the duration the status effect lasts, which is converted to an integer.
type: A string specifying the attribute that the status will modify.
increase: A boolean indicating whether the status effect increases (true) or decreases (false) the attribute.
percentBool: A boolean that, if true, indicates the effect is based on a percentage, requiring an intensityPercent. If false, the effect is a direct numerical value, requiring an intensityNumber.
intensityNumber: An optional integer specifying the numerical value of the effect, required when percentBool is false.
intensityPercent: An optional integer specifying the percentage value of the effect, required when percentBool is true.
stackable: A boolean indicating whether multiple instances of this status can be stacked on the target.
refreshable: A boolean indicating whether applying the same status refreshes its duration.
chanceToApplyPercent: An int from 0 - 100 that dictates the % chance for the status to actually apply. This should be lower for more powerful statuses for balancing.
description: A string providing a user-friendly description of the status effect.
If percentBool is true and intensityPercent is not provided, the function throws an exception stating that intensityPercent cannot be null. Similarly, if percentBool is false and intensityNumber is not provided, it throws an exception stating that intensityNumber cannot be null. The function ensures that only relevant intensity fields are populated based on the value of percentBool, setting the other to null and parsing the numeric value from duration.

The Type must first address whether it is a player or an enemy, then the attribute of that object it will effect. You can only use the following stats:
currentHealth, Health (max health), currentManaPoints, ManaPoints (max mana points), Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Constitution and Charisma.

You now need to output a list of Statuses in parsable JSON format that correspond to the statuses you assigned earlier to each dynamic enemy attack. For example:

{
  "statusList": [
    {
      "Name": "Energy Sap",
      "Duration": 2,
      "Type": "Enemy_currentManaPoints",
      "Increase": false,
      "PercentBool": true,
      "IntensityNumber": null,
      "IntensityPercent": 15,
      "Stackable": true,
      "Refreshable": true,
      "ChanceToApplyPercent": 75,
      "Description": "Saps the enemy's mana over a prolonged period."
    },
    {
      "Name": "Heal",
      "Duration": 1,
      "Type": "Player_Health",
      "Increase": true,
      "PercentBool": true,
      "IntensityNumber": null,
      "IntensityPercent": 20,
      "Stackable": true,
      "Refreshable": true,
      "ChanceToApplyPercent": 90,
      "Description": "Heals the player for 20% of their maximum health."
    },
    ...
  ]
}

This method allows dynamic creation of status effects tailored to specific gameplay scenarios, enhancing the game's interactivity and complexity. It is crucial that there are no syntax errors.
