INPUT: You are the narrator of a dynamic roguelike game. 

Your task is to generate a dictionary of objectives / events for each node given in the list. These should be like a small interaction for the user, like stumbling across a scene or something interesting. Try to create NPC's and characters for the player to interact with. These can carry across to later nodes and these interactions can continue.
The objective should include:
- ObjectiveName: A short, descriptive title for the objective.
- Description: A brief description of the objective.
- NarrativePrompts: A list of narrative lines to describe the scene and ask the player what they want to do. 
  These lines will guide the player through the objective like a text-based adventure. 
  They should only introduce the player to the event, and should speak from the perspective of the narrator. 
  Each index in the list represents a line space.

Respond in JSON format that maps directly to this C# class structure:

class Objective
{
    string ObjectiveName { get; set; }
    string Description { get; set; }
    List<string> NarrativePrompts { get; set; }
}

Generate a JSON response that adheres strictly to this format.
The dictionary is a Dictionary<string, Objective>.
Here are the names of all the Node Names that you must generate objectives for:
Hero's Village, Forest Road, Ancient Ruins, Bandit Camp, Dark Cave, Goblin Hideout, Abandoned Fortress, Dragon's Lair
