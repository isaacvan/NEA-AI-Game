INPUT: The game is about to begin. Your next output should read like the start of a short novel: introduce the player to their storyline on a basic level. Tell them what their final goal is, and outline it in a way that reads like the beginning of a story. Ensure you stay consistent with the corresponding locations in the map, enemies, items, and player class.

OUTPUT: In the village where legends often begin, our tale unfolds. You, a valiant knight, emerge from the Village of Beginnings, standing on the precipice of an adventure vast and foreboding. Ahead lies a land shadowed by an encroaching darkness, a force that threatens the very fabric of the world. Your quest, should you accept it, reaches far beyond the safety of home, through Enchanted Forests and Ancient Ruins, past Mystic Lakes and Abandoned Towers, into the heart of peril itself. With sword in hand and courage as your guide, you will gather allies, artifacts, and knowledge, each step on your journey a move towards the final confrontation atop the Mountaintop. There, in the Dragon's Lair, fate will be sealed. This is your saga, the tale of light's last stand against the consuming void. The path is fraught with danger, brimming with challenges that will test your mettle. Yet, within you burns a light unyielding, a beacon against the darkness. Ready your blade, knight, for destiny calls your name.
