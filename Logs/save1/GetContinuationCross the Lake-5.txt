INPUT: The player inputted this in response to your narrative: skibidi rizz the undead

As a reminder, your last narrative lines were A serene lake lies before you, its surface calm, reflecting the sky.Will you find a way around, or risk crossing the water?: With a deep breath, you plunge into the cold, murky water; a challenge you welcome as the Lighthouse beckons you forth. But beware! To your left, a hidden path shrouded in shadows appears promising, yet equally dangerous. Above, the eerie song of Raven steals your attention. Will you brave the water, explore the hidden path, or heed the Raven's message?: Cautiously, you diverge from the lake, stepping onto the hidden path. The chilling whispers of the wind hint at danger yet an alluring promise of discovery. Ahead, a campfire flickers mysteriously. Your heart quickens as you approach. Will you confront what awaits at the fire or retreat back to the ominous lake?: Picking up a rock and tossing it towards the campfire, you hold your breath. Moments pass before a rustling sound breaks the silence. An Undead! Do you rush to attack or melt into the shadows, perhaps to find a more strategic approach?
