The Lost Wanderer stirs, its melancholy gaze meeting yours. It speaks, its voice a hollow echo, "The path ahead holds danger, traveller. Tread carefully." The Lost Wanderer pauses, its eyes reflecting the weight of a timeless journey. "Your quest," it whispers, "is to find and bring balance to the Astra Confluence, a force out of harmony, causing chaos and spawning the cruel creatures you encounter. To aid you in this mission, I will provide this item." Seeing your anticipation, he hands over the Starshard Staff. As you pick up the Starshard Staff, a shiver of energy runs through you. Its shimmering form seems to resonate with your spirit. The Lost Wanderer gives you a nod of approval. "That staff carries great power," he murmurs, "use it wisely. Now, go forth, face the lurking Eclipse Wraiths and restore harmony to the Astra Confluence. May the stars guide your path."
