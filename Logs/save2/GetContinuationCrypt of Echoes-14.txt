INPUT: The player inputted this in response to your narrative: escape the cave

As a reminder, your last narrative lines were The cave unveils a forgotten underground city.Distant whispers cling on the ancient stone walls.What will you find in its shadowy corners? As you explore, the eerie silence is broken by a low growl. The celestial serpent has sensed your presence. Steeling your nerves, you venture forth to confront the Celestial Serpent. Yet, it senses your bravado and slithers into shadows, ready for the impending showdown. Your challenge echoes through the caverns as a call to battle. With a thunderous roar, the Celestial Serpent emerges from the shadows, ready for your courage to be challenged. With precision, you hurl a rock at the Serpent's eyes. It reels back, momentarily disoriented - a small victory, but the battle is far from over. Seizing the opportunity, you charge, sword in hand. As you strike, the serpent recoils but remains undeterred. The battle rages on. In the heart of the battle, your eyes scan the surroundings. Amidst the chaos, you notice a loose stalactite hanging precariously above the serpent. A possible weapon, if used wisely. You attempt to reach the stalactite but it hangs too high out of grasp. You'll need to knock it down somehow. With a strong hurl, the stone hits the stalactite's base. It shudders, then falls, barely missing the serpent. Will you try again? Taking a deep breath, you carefully aim and strike a second stalactite. With a triumphant crash, it impales the startled serpent. The monster screeches, writhing in pain. Your plan worked. As the serpent writhes, you sneak past to the guarded treasure. As you reach out to take it, the serpent suddenly lunges. Can you dodge in time? You narrowly evade the serpent's lunge, heart pounding. Ignoring your fear, you quickly seize the treasure â€“ a source of ancient power - and make a break towards daylight.
